# Music in the Big City

In this first project of the course, I was assigned to compare the music preferences of Springfield and Shelbyville users. As the first project, this project contains some instructions about structure, directions, and conclusions from Practicum.

I got data from Y.Music to test some of the hypotheses below and compare user behavior in the two cities.

# Hypothesis
- User activity varies depending on the day and city.
- On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville users listen to different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
- Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville rap music has more fans.

# Data Description
- 'userID' — User ID
- 'Track' — the track title of the song
- 'artist' — artist name
- 'genre' — music genre
- 'City' — the city where the user is located
- 'time' — the length of time the song is playing
- 'Day' — day of the week
